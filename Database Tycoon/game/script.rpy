    who "Hi! Are you the new student? I don't think I've seen you before."
    "Hi, yes, today is my first day. I was told to check in and pick up my class schedule?"
    who "Absolutely! I should have your forms here, if you give me a minute. What are you specializing in?"
    "I'm studying database administration."
    who "Oh, that sounds difficult! What made you decide to study at HCSSHS?"
    "I've dreamed of coming here ever since I was little, when I first decided to become a database administrator. The program here is unmatched."

    "With hundreds running simultaneously, the school's infrastructure is a beast. You don't just learn theory here -- you're thrown right into the fire."
    "The systems are complex, constantly changing, and the only way to keep up is to be the best. Failure is not an option."
